# Artificial Neuron Networks

This directory contains two sub-directories. These are for the two different types of artifical Neuron Networks:

1. Single Layer Perceptron (SLP) Model
2. Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) Model

This is a first foray into Manchine Learning and Data Science for me and I aim to build both projects from the principles of concepts, as appose to using pre-exising libaries. So I only intend to use baisc useful libraries, such as Numpy, MatPlotLib and Random.

These projects further knowledge learned in Systems Analysis course during my MSc and the Unversity of Exeter.
